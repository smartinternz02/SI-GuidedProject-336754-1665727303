Ship Classification using IBM Watson

ABOUT THE PROJECT:In this project, we introduce a new convolutional neural network classification algorithm 
capable of classifying five classes of ships, including cargo, military, carrier, cruise and tanker 
ships, in inland waterways. All the images are present in a single folder so we will first be dividing 
them into categories with the help of a train.csv file that contains all the filenames of the training  
images.
